## About Me:
> Engineer programmer with more than three years of experience. Extensive experience with databases, data processing, storage and recording. I work well independently as well as in group settings where I am skilled at contributing to the team.
> The main purpose of my training at RSSchool is to get as much knowledge as possible on modern technologies, to master them, and, if lucky, to get to work at EPAM. JavaScript is a fast and dynamic programming language that I fell in love with the first line of code. I give studying all my free time. I am independent, always bring the case to the end. Responsible approach to perform any tasks. I am not afraid of difficulties, because after the most difficult task you always reach a new level of knowledge.
